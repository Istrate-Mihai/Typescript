TS Type System:
- used to catch errors
- write type annotations
- active during environment
- doesn't provide performance optimization

Typescript code -> TS Compiler -> JS code

npm install -g typescript ts-node
tsc --help

vs code Setup:

file > preferences > settings

npm init -y
npm install axios

Helps with typo on object properties.
Helps keep track of errors when passing arguments to functions.
